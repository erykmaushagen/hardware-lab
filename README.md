## Course Overview

**Block 1: Introduction & Simple Circuits**  
- Basics of VHDL, tools: **GHDL** & **GTKWave**  
- Logic gates, adders, multiplexers, encoders

**Block 2: Memory & Complex Circuits**  
- Latches, flip-flops, shift registers, RAM  
- Finite state machines, multipliers

**Block 3: Processor Design**  
- Intro to processor design via **MIPS processor**  
- Advanced processor topics
